# Context API Light Dark Mode

This project demonstrates the implementation of light and dark mode using the Context API. The background color and theme of the travel information card are dynamically changed by toggling a button. It is designed for educational purposes and can be easily integrated into both pages and components. This implementation is particularly useful for large-scale applications where consistent theming is required.
